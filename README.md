Introduction to Python programming - course materials

I taught a course called "Methods of Formal Linguistic Analysis" at Iowa State University, during Spring 2016 and again in Spring 2018. Despite the name, the course was all about teaching introductory python programming to a class of Applied Linguistics graduate students. Every one in the class came from a English language teaching background. So, while most of the class had way more experience than me as teachers, they were all my student-programmers! This makes this class one of its kind, in my view. Since I am anyway out of academia now, I decided to put up my materials online. This may seem more like self-shaming in public.. but, these materials can be useful for someone who is in a similar situation, or someone who wants to learn with this background. I had some success with this, some students really continued to do some programming for their graduate work later.
